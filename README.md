#Project Title: Anzo Studio Clone

Description:

This project is a frontend clone of Anzo Studio, developed using React and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The aim was to replicate the sleek design and interactive features of the original studio while enhancing performance and user experience.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The clone is not responsive, but ensuring a seamless experience across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Dynamic Animations: Leveraging GSAP, the project features smooth and engaging animations that enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the interface.
Component-Based Architecture: Built with React, the application utilizes a component-based architecture for maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy updates and integration of new features.
User-Friendly Navigation: The navigation is intuitive, providing easy access to various sections and functionalities of the studio.
High-Quality Assets: Carefully selected images and graphics enhance the aesthetic quality, aligning with the original Anzo Studio design.
Technologies Used:

React: For building interactive user interfaces.
GSAP: For advanced animations and transitions.
CSS: For styling used tailwind css.
This project demonstrates my ability to create modern, animated web applications and showcases my proficiency in using popular frontend technologies.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
